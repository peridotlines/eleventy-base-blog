This site has been a mess for a hot minute, but I think I've finally turned a corner, and now it's all on my shoulders so hopefully things won't crash and burn the way they have repeatedly since mid-November.

Do I know what I'm doing? No. Do I have hosting set up for the next year? Yes. Will I post more frequently? Who can say!

It's sort of a blessing and a curse to go out and do something, return home, and then realize I did nothing whatsoever to document the activity. It's not like "the blog" needs me to post pictures of our slippery ramble through the state park, but I'd feel better about everything if I at least had a picture to toss up on the page along with whatever minuscule character count I manage. It was a cold afternoon stroll, but pleasant enough that we'll probably try to do it again with some grippier footwear before the end of the winter. Anyone have recommendations for yaktrax or the like?

We had been hoping to take our snowshoes out, since they've lived on the wall in our garage for over a year. Things looked very promising, and then it spent every day between Christmas and now being foggy, and then rainy, and all of that squishy snow turned to icy crusts before it melted into pretty much nothing. There's still white stuff on the ground, but it's not the sort of snow that needs anything more than a sturdy pair of boots to navigate. So, our snowshoes languish again. But it's going to get bitterly cold into next week, so maybe there will be something more winterish on the horizon. Do I need snowshoes to justify being outside? No, I don't. But, a co-worker summed it up perfectly when she said she wanted the "winter voyager" experience, and there's nothing that captures that more than tromping through the woods on a pair of snowshoes.

All of the melting has done nothing for my latent urge to hop on a bicycle and tool around town. The things holding me back are that we have two very nice bikes that will not tolerate the salt and moisture, we don't have anywhere good to clean and dry them in our apartment, and I don't have a studded tire to make the the trek just a little more secure. I'm still very set on looking into getting a winter bike next year. I know I'll be out on my own, but two days of full sunshine with practically balmy temperatures would have been glorious to experience on a bike. Luckily, one of the shops in our area sells off their rental fleet every year, so I'm very much preparing to keep an eye out for their sale next fall, so maybe I can make cycling more of a year-round thing.

Stay tuned as I mentally prepare myself to [loop the lake](https://mntrails.com/event/loop-the-lake-ride/) in June, because I'm still set on taking part in that nonsense too. Hopefully there will be more pictures of that since I have yet to document much from the seat of a bicycle.

Anyway, Happy New Year everyone. Good luck in 2025, because we're all going to need it, and each other.
