It's June, also known as Pride Month, and I'm looking at this blog I abandoned 8 months ago, because October got hard and life (of course) just kept happening.

Life has been an endless string of weeks that start off with dread for the days ahead and end with me wondering how it's Friday "already." We got through the holidays, started a new year, picked up some new hobbies, and now summer is around the corner and the next 2 months will go by in an absolute blur.

We never got around to using our snowshoes this winter, since there was barely any snow. Maybe we'll get dumped on next year and actually be able to use them again.

We also joined a Dungeons and Dragons campaign, and are slowly learning the ins and outs of tabletop role playing. My halfling monk, Niv, is a blur on the battlefield, when I manage to roll my dice well. I still need some work on the storytelling side of things, since it's been a hot minute since I played pretend with a whole group of people. It's a fun challenge though, especially watching my fellow players do cool things.

The only other adventure in store for me right now has been re-learning how to ride a bike. I've been going on a bunch of daily walks through the neighborhood (one of the many perks of working from home) and a bike at a yard sale caught my eye. $25 later, it turns out I've retained _maybe_ 5% of the bike-riding skills I used to possess.

Ivory was kind enough to sit outsideÂ today, making sure I didn't ride into the swamp by our apartment. YouTube offered a lot of helpful tips on getting started, and by the end of 30 to 45 minutes, I was actually pedalling and able to _mostly_ control where I was going. Having now fixed the handlebars so I can brake properly, I'm hoping to try again with greater success tomorrow.

I won't even joke about entering my cycling era, because I can barely entertain the idea of leaving our apartment complex. Still, I did feel pretty good once I was able to get going and maintain my momentum. There's now a smooth (if hilly) path on the edge of our neighborhood, so I'm thinking that might be my next excursion, if I can get over the fear of going "too fast."

Hopefully it won't be another 8 months before I post here again.

Happy Pride to everyone who celebrates, and for everyone who would rather we weren't celebrating... I'm not going to be confrontational about it but, good luck with your discomfort this month.
