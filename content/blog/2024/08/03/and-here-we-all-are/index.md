Did I forget I still need to do a post today and it's after 7pm? 100% yes.

Life now is busier than it was when I was doing this a year ago. It's weird to realize there are lots of things taking up my days, and somehow I made the choice to be doing them. After 2020, so much of my time slowed down to pretty much just being at home and maybe going to meet our knitting group once a week. Now?

I've been making an effort to be more active while the weather supports it. We somehow had a blessedly cool start to the summer, and I've spent so much time outside just enjoying the ability to do that and not freeze, broil, or breathe smoke. And then the last 3 weeks hit and it's been hot, and then humid, and then smoky, and apparently I've built up enough of a habit doing things on the daily, that when I can't I get a bit antsy and on edge, frustrated that it's not in the cards for the day.

Our Thursdays have also gotten busier. It used to just be a weekly knitting group, but then we decided to search out a Dungeons & Dragons game and someone was good enough to take us in. We spend a lot of time going over the ins and outs and trying to keep up with a high level campaign every other week now. I'm playing a Lightfoot Halfling Monk, and trying to get used to throwing myself into combat since Niv has the HP and constitution to do that while Kate wants to hang back and be sure they're making the "right" move.

And we've been watching a lot of Dimension 20. We're just winding up our watch of The Seven, which I think we found even more compelling than the Fantasy High series it spun off from. I'm hoping we can try Never Stop Blowing Up next, since we're really making use of our Dropout subscription (which has totally been worth it).

It's been a while since I was just this busy living life. Having fallen out of a journalling or blogging habit, it feels more like I'm trying to wedge this into a packed schedule. But, when I take a step back and look at things, I probably have time. It's more of a question of motivation than anything else. So, hopefully Blaugust will help me find the motivation, since this place is still important to me.

I'm hoping I can bring some of the busyness here, especially the bike adventures, now that I have a rack and will be able to start doing more errands and using it around town. I'm still thinking it will be carrying me to the office on Monday, so stay tuned to see if I actually have the nerve to "commute" the mile and a half from work to the office. (The scariest part is going to be navigating the roundabout... At least I _hope_ that will be the scariest part)

Happy Friday everyone. Have a fantastic weekend!
