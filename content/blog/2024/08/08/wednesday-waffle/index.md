I have barely survived the first week of Blaugust 2024. Prioritizing this place on the daily feels next to impossible, especially with how little time I've spent here in the past few months.

We did manage to make syrup from the juice we made on Sunday. So, I'm hoping we have decent cherry syrup for pancakes, or maybe it will just go on ice cream sundaes, but it at least looks pretty.

We also made a short bike trek yesterday, and I'm finding that method of running errands to be more and more desirable, especially once we both have baskets to carry things around.

It's gotten weirdly cold, which is going to make riding around even better. Honestly, I'm looking forward to fall a little more than I expected to be, since there's a chance we might be able to hit part of the trail around the lake and take in some of the colors in the state park. I don't want to rush to the end of the summer though; I'm enjoying it right now, and all the time I'm able to be outside. I don't want to figure out other ways to be active, when I've only just found something I enjoy doing outside.

All-in-all not my best showing for the first week of Blaugust. I'm hoping I can get my legs under me a little bit more next week. Putting together an intro post sounds good, especially as things have changed in the last year. Plus, next week I'm on vacation, so as long as I don't lose my brain to "vacation time" I should have a little more to offer here in terms of writing and photos.

What a weird Wednesday this was.
