I am no more prepared for this endeavor than I was last year, but, here goes nothing!

At least this time around I knew this was coming. Of course, it's Thursday, and one of my busier Thursdays at that, so I'm hoping I can get something short and sweet thrown together to mark the occasion, and go on with my day.

For those not in the know, there's a helpful [informational post](https://aggronaut.com/2024/07/12/blaugust-2024-is-coming/) covering the basics of this whole thing. In the wake of social media really fracturing into a bunch of different factions, I was hoping blogging would see a bit more of a resurgence. I'm not sure I've seen that coming true, but Blaugust is still happening, so it's not like blogging is dead.

I'm hoping to use the [BlueSky Feed](https://bsky.app/profile/did:plc:hdgcfurserw5mcmdcwv7lx6o/feed/aaafnyvusfjyg) to keep track of others participating this year. I'm sure things will fall between the cracks, but I got a little overwhelmed looking at the wall of posts in my RSS reader (yeah, those are still a thing) last year.

So, find me over at [BlueSky](https://bsky.app/profile/peridotlines.com) or comment here if you're doing Blaugust 2024.

I've been lost in a bit of a haze when it comes to my life online lately, but I'm hoping to find some other blogs to follow, I'm just not sure what it is I'm looking for. Some of this comes down trying to relive to my old LiveJournal days, but I still appreciate being able to read long form content, and I'd love to look at something besides posts on Reddit.

I'll be doing an introduction post some time next week, but in short, this place is mostly rambling on the following subjects: cats, LEGO, fiber arts, gaming (rarely), life in northern Minnesota, and (something new) bike adventures.
