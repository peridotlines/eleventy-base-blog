I managed to go just over 2 weeks, posting daily. And when the weekend came, and the schedule I exist in the majority of the time ceased to be, and I just totally forgot to post anything until it was too late at night to be bothered.

This is the thing I will probably continue to struggle with, even outside of Blaugust. During the work week, there are some very obvious times when it just makes sense for me to take the time to write up a post. I'm not at a place for me to do it in the morning 5 days out of the week. But the weekend, morning writing is when it absolutely makes the most sense.

Yesterday, I didn't even think about doing it, because we have a weekend project taking up all of my brainspace.

We have a spare bedroom in our apartment that we want to be more functional. We've also inherited a significant number of items in the last year, which ended up in either our garage, or in this spare room as we try to figure out what to do with them. This weekend was finally the time we were able to get something done with that space, which has meant getting sturdier and more easily accessible shelving, and attempting to organize the stuff we have. Last weekend, it was all about clearing out a corner so we could move my old desk into the room (we now have a workspace for our sewing machine), and this weekend is probably going to be about clearing off the pile of things that currently exist on the bed, because we realized the shelving unit we currently have in there isn't working for us. Plus, there's a lot of yarn that pretty much always requires an excavation through a stack of plastic bins to access, and it's not what we want.

Is any of this interesting? Absolutely not. Am I looking forward to things being put away and that room not looking the way it's looked for pretty much the last year? 100% yes. (I'm also dreading the emotional turmoil of getting rid of several things on that shelf that are no longer functioning that well, but have been with me for the last twenty to thirty years.)

So, with all of that in mind, I'm kicking off the "Staying Motivated" week of Blaugust by (hopefully) starting a new streak. We'll see how I feel about motivation when Saturday rolls around, especially since next weekend is finally Pride weekend, and I'll be so much more focused on that.

We've got a lot to accomplish on this weirdly hazy day (seriously Canada, we don't love the perpetual smoke in the air right now). So, it's probably time I got some breakfast and coffee, and got around to it.

Maybe by next weekend I'll finally be around to scheduling posts or something, because the answer staring me in the face with this whole "consistency" thing is "write when you have the time, and schedule it to post later" which absolutely makes sense in theory. But, as with most other things in my life, putting that theory into practice is where the snags happen.
