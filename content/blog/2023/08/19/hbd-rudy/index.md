It's been a LONG week, and I'm not up for more than wishing our resident orange a very happy 7th birthday!

I'd wish for more turns with the cell for him, but he's already a pretty big hog when it comes to his smarts.

Rudy is our very sweet boy though, and even Chanski seemed to be interested in singing him a song today.

And now, he's pretty tuckered out from all of the partying.
