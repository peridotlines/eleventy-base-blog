description: Somehow, I'm halfway through this monthly blogging endeavor. I'm starting to look past August, wondering how I can maintain this habit outside of a challenge. Written for Blaugust 2023.

Post-Blaugust, I'm not sure I'll be able to continue doing daily posts, unless I figure out a different time to do them. Thursday is typically my knitting night, it's also sort of the last gasp of energy I have for the week before Friday rolls around and I remember I am a human outside of doing a job, and the vibes sort of change.

At the same time, I have to acknowledge that when I'm in a habit of doing something daily, I'm more likely to do it than if I just do it when I "feel like it". Thursday is just sort of the day of the week I don't really know what to write about. I pretty much have something figured out for every other day of the week, but Thursday is sort of lost in a fog. Right now, I'm leaning towards something like picking a monthly theme and focusing on that on Thursdays, but we'll have to see if that really works for me or not.

I found out about Blaugust through a Mastodon instance that seems to focus primarily on gaming, mostly MMORP gaming, to be specific. So, I've gotten to see a lot of posts about Baldur's Gate 3 and Palia in the last couple weeks, two things that are completely off my radar. It's one of those times when I sort of question my "status" as a gamer, since neither of these even existed to me until I started seeing a lot of people writing about them. I'm still sort of searching for the blogging bubble where I might feel a bit more comfortable diving into the comment section, something I'm reticent to do most of the time. But, I did get an invite to Bluesky today, so now I get to see if that's where I might find others as well, since Blaugust appears to be a thing there as well.

It's interesting to see a community sort of fracture, but then reveal that there are places outside of it, which I'm happy to start discovering. This is when "change is good" is in fact true, for as much as I despise change in general. It's good not to get so settled and comfortable at times. (I can tell I've been writing daily for almost 2 weeks, because there's no way I would have been remotely as positive about things changing at the start of the month)
