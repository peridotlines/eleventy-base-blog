I knew there would come a point when even having suggested themes wouldn't be enough of a boost to get me over, around, or through a bit of writers block. I'm going to engage in the exercise of writing and posting through it instead of succumbing to it today, but I'm pretty sure it will be a frustrating experience for everyone involved.

I might be a little bit ready for summer to be over. I'm not ready for winter to get here, but there's a hint of fall in the air (and literal colors changing on some trees) and I'm looking forward to closing a window at night and not wondering when I'm going to wake up and feel like I'm being stifled with humidity. We're also going to be under another Air Quality alert tomorrow morning, in the Orange zone. I thought 2021 was bad when it came to smoke, but it's just been so persistent this year. It becomes a question everyday if we can leave the windows open or not, and our electric bill skyrockets because the only way to not feel like we're just breathing our own breath all day is to run the air conditioner. At least if its freezing cold outside I won't feel like I'm depriving myself of something by keeping the windows closed.

It's been a while since I felt this way about a Monday. I'm sure a good chunk of that comes down to having a poor night of sleep and a smaller amount of caffeine this morning. It's incredible how much of an impact a disruption to routine can have, because I'm dragging in a way that I haven't at the end of the day for a while. It's the sort of feeling that makes me look back through the day and wonder where I should have taken a nap. It's not like I didn't get things done, but all of my mental energy went to work today, and I'm left with very little to offer here. It's not the first time this will happen, and it certainly won't be the last. This is where the scheduling of posts and working ahead are going to save me, but I actually have to do that to save myself, which isn't exactly fair in my opinion. But, it's not like time travel exists , offering me the ability to go back and prepare something ahead of time.

I guess at least my Bullet Journal has been on track for the past couple weeks. After my last [little rant](https://peridotlines.com/2023/08/09/the-bog-of-eternal-productivity-management/) about it, I spent a some time looking through my schedule, figuring out where some things were falling apart, and it's ended up serving me pretty well for the past 3 weeks. It definitely helped me catch up with some things I'd fallen behind on, which is exactly the point of it. Part of it may also be down to getting a new desk and reorganizing my workspace, because for some reason that sort of activity always seems to give me a renewed sense of purpose. I'm not sure how long I can keep riding that wave, but it's doing something for me at the moment, I guess.

I'm three-quarters of the way through _Tress of the Emerald Sea_. Maybe I'll finish it tonight, I guess we'll see just how awake I am for any reading as the evening progresses. So far, I'm loving the crazy magic system (even though it's completely terrifying), and I adore the narrator. I can't say this about everything Brandon Sanderson writes, but this book makes me stop and re-read things sometimes, just to savor them. It's making me think about re-starting my commonplace book habits, because there are some things that I read and I just want to keep reading them over and over again, the way I will put a song on repeat. Sometimes its fascinating subject matter, but a lot of the time it's stuff that I sort of feel like I could have written, but not in the "anyone could write that" kind of way. It just sort of feels like somehow it came from my own head, even though I know it didn't. It's just... truth, or something like it.

I'm trying to think of a "fifth thing" to write about here, since that seems like a nice, round number for some reason. But I'm coming up blank again. So, I guess that's it for today. It's also probably the bloggiest blog I've written in I can't remember how long. I mean, a weblog is just a collection of thoughts, I suppose they don't all have to have some detailed, over arching theme, right?
