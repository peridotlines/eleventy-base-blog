And Blaugust 2023 officially comes to a close. I'm relieved its over, especially since the slog of work this week has meant writing posts was akin to pulling teeth at times.

I'm hoping I'll come up with something more interesting tomorrow, considering it will be the first day of September, and the start of a long weekend.

I'm going to do my best to keep posting here on a daily basis, whatever that means. Because, it's easier to post here than it is to post anywhere else, if I'm being completely honest. The flux of social media at the moment leaves a lot to be desired in terms of where it makes sense to share anything.

I'm glad to have Bluesky as an option, especially since Twitter seems like it's about two steps away from requiring some sort of blood sacrifice to keep using the service, while everything else is subsumed by the Zuck. Wordpress certainly has its issues, but at least this website is mine? Right?

I'm definitely still trying to find _my_ community when it comes to this whole blogging thing. I'm just not sure where it is yet, so I'm going to keep sending these little pings out into the universe of the internet until I see what comes back. (As long as its not spam, because I have no patience for any of that).
