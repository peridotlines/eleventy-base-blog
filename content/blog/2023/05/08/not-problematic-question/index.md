Just as a test, here I am, spending today's 30 minute lunch break trying to answer a writing prompt.

> What are your favorite brands and why?

<!--more Thoughts on DMC Thread, acrylic yarn, and stationery-->

Of course, today's prompt is something that "Informed, conscientious, consumer-Kate" finds annoying, because what "brands" would I possibly consider to be my favorite? What does that even say about me? On the surface, it doesn't feel like much, but if I took a more granular approach and just applied that question to the realm of crafting activities I engage in, suddenly it's very important and legitimate.

Off the top of my head, DMC thread comes to mind. As someone who has engaged in a variety of crafts using 6-strand embroidery floss, DMC thread is always my go-to. Could I use some random thread that came in a variety pack from a random seller on Amazon? Probably yes. But DMC thread just moves differently for some reason. It feels less likely to tangle, it moves through cloth better when I'm using it to sew, knots slide more easily when I'm making a friendship bracelet. It's the sort of thing that doesn't seem like it should matter, but it definitely makes for a more enjoyable crafting experience.

As a long-time knitter, I can't really point to a specific brand and say "that's the yarn for me!" I think pretty much anyone who sticks with the craft for a while sort of develops these eras of acquisition when it comes to yarn, and then you go back through your stash later and reach down to the bottom of a tote and remember "oh yeah, all of this Sugar and Cream yarn is from when I couldn't stop making fancy washcloths for everyone!" except that time was several years in the past, and the idea of working with cotton seems almost abhorrent to you now. I'd say I'm probably a bit of a yarn snob, especially when it comes to acrylic yarn, but even those have their uses, when you want to knit something for someone who isn't a fiber enthusiast, and therefore can't be trusted to hand-wash and air-dry a garment for years in the future. It's not what I want to knit with, but its a point of pride for me that I made a set of Christmas stockings for a friend and her family one year, and they've been able to continue using them. There's no threat of pulling them out of storage one year and finding out moths have finally feasted upon them. Plus, Red Heart has all of the colors, so while I can't profess to LOVE knitting with it, I'm unlikely to ever really turn my nose up at a project that utilizes it.

I think the only other thing that comes to mind in terms of brand loyalty would be focused on stationery supplies. There is such a thing as the perfect pen, although, the number of times that I think I've found THE ONE only to stop using it later because something better came along, makes me think there are perfect pens for a certain time, and then another pen can become the perfect one. I used to swear by Pentel's Energel pens, but now, I'd probably be happier with a .033 Pilot G2, and that's only if I can't get my hands on my fountain pen, which at this point just has a refillable cartridge that I top up every couple weeks. And I'm using any of these writing implements in a Leuchtturm1917 A5, dot grid notebook, or some extra-sticky post-its.

And thus concludes my brandname dropping for the day.
